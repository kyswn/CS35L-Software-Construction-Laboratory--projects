Q1: It does improve the performance because it is a behaviour against the POSIX.1-2008 rule that " -a and 
-A should override each other" , which is not good 

Q2: maybe there are other things built on this bug, assuming -a would override -A. After we debug, those things might not work as expected

Q3: there would be an error, because, the function random.choice() would not work

Q4: it wouldn't work
except IOError as (errno, strerror) is not a python 3 feature

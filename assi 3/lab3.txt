first download it 
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

then extract it 
tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

the verification fails, it says no such directory

make a new directory
cd /u/cs/grad/yining
mkdir coreutils

compile the file
cd coreutils-8.29
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/yining/coreutils
make 
make install

reproduce the bug
cd ..
cd coreutils
cd bin
./ls -a -A
./ls -aA
it still shows . an ..

put the patch on
cd ..
cd ..
cd coreutils-8.29
paste the patch into a file called path.diff (using winscp)
it says when patching file NEWS, Hunk #1 failed at 4

make 
there is an error

I delete the coretils file and extract it again, and then edit the file so that only the src/ls.c remains, then I put the patch on, and then make 
patch -p1 < patch.diff
make

the modified ls works withn the src directory without the bug, and the unmodified still has bug

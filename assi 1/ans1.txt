In all my answers, I list the shell commands I used first, and then give the answer to the problem

1. 
man man

man -k
2. 
which mv
which sh

/usr/local/cs/bin/mv
/usr/bin/sh

3. 
find /usr/bin -executable -name ?r

/usr/bin/tr
/usr/bin/ar
/usr/bin/pr

4.
readlink /usr/bin/emacs

/etc/alternatives/emacs

5.
usr/bin/gcc --version
gcc --version

4.8.5
8.2.0
because we use different paths here, therefore we are actually running two different files, which have different version from each other

6.man chmod

u+sx:give user who owns it the permission to set user or group ID on execution, and to execute

o-w: depreive other users not in the file's group of the permission to write

7.man find 

find /usr/local/cs -mtime -28 

8.
which find
man which
find /usr/bin -type l

9.
man find 
find /usr/lib64 -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' |sort|head -n 1

tc18.5/Tix8.4.3/bitmaps/act_fold.gif


find /usr/lib64 -name '.*'-type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' |sort|head -n 1

python2.7/site-package/numpy/f2py/test/src/assumed_shape/.f2py_f2cmap

10. 
man locale
man 7 locale

make a 5000000 byte file

a.
strace -o strbc ./tr2b a b < big_file.txt > strbc.txt 
cat strbc | wc -l
it shows 31

strace -o struc ./tr2u a b < big_file.txt > struc.txt 
cat struc | wc -l
it shows 10000026
it also takes significantly more time to process

b.
strace -o strbt ./tr2b a b < big_file.txt 
cat strbt | wc -l
it shows 31

strace -o strut ./tr2u a b < big_file.txt 
cat strut | wc -l
it shows 10000026
it also takes significantly more time to process

overall, the unbuffered version takes significantly more system calls than the buffered version.
Also, the speed of copying to terminal takes the same time as copying to another file
